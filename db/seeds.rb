# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# Contact.create(first_name: "Buck", last_name: "Dude", email: "whatever", phone_number: "333")

# Contact.create(first_name: "Josh", last_name: "Gordon", email: "gdawg@gmail.com", phone_number: "333-222-1111")
